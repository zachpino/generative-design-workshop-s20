### Exercise

Work in small groups to complete a parametric *rig*. What datapoints are critical to making an object *custom* fit. What would allow that object to be *uniquely* targeted to specific users? How do we begin to parameterize *preference*, not just *fit*? How broad an audience can be served by this rig? What are the *extents* of the rig that you've defined?
