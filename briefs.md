### Project Description

The combination of the [quantified self movement](http://feltron.com/), [interactive generative design tools](https://www.shapediver.com/), and [digital fabrication](https://www.shapeways.com/) as a [service for fulfillment and delivery](https://www.shapeways.com/business/whitelabel-shipping-solutions) is creating opportunity for contemporary designers to create *personal products* with *personal data*. We have looked at [several](https://iohanna.com/Form-Follows-Data) [examples](http://www.stefanieposavec.com/airtransformed) of [these](https://www.pentagram.com/work/giorgia-lupi-other-stories/story) [often](http://paulheinicker.com/goodnightsms/) [weird](http://meshu.io/) [pieces](http://mischertraxler.com/) of [physicalized](https://www.adriensegal.com/) [data](https://madmuseum.org/sonic-arcade-audiowear), which all explore the collection of possible relationships between an individual, their social group, their space, their past behaviors, and their participation and responsiblity in larger social, experiential, and environmental outcomes. These objects have the potential to reveal startling patterns in our own behavior, and support a newly empowered sculpting of the self -- facilitated by informed data-gathering and -visualization.

This relationship between collected data and our own behavioral psychology is the nexus to be explored in this project, through the production of unique, personal generatively designed objects.

How can physicalized data become a seed for behavior change? A reward for maintaining positive behaviors? A block against regressing into formerly damaging behaviors? A stark reminder of our past and future weaknesses and strengths? A provocation for new action?

With the linked works above and *Dear Data* as inspiration, envision how an *individual-person-scale* dataset could be embedded in a singular or set of *hand-scale* objects such as jewelry, fashion accessories, desktop objects, or specialty equipment for various activities. Consider how the dataset can effectively (and potentially poetically) relate to the physicalized data. Then, use Grasshopper and digital fabrication technologies to bring these objects in the world through Grasshopper and other generative design tools.


### Deliverables

- Three versions of your design, featuring data representing three different entities -- fabricated by hand or machine. For example, if I am designing a necklace featuring data on where a person travels, I could ask three different people for data and make a necklace for each of them. Or, alternatively, I could ask one person for data spanning three years, and make a necklace for each year.

- Annotated dataset used in object. Ideally all input data for this project is real, but if that is impossible, random or sample data can be used for up to two of the variations.

- Annotated Grasshopper and Rhino file(s) of all models

- 250-500 word description of your project, the design and fabrication choices you made, and how you imagine its existence might prompt, accelerate, or maintain behavior change. 

- Illustrated key to reading your objects, designed for a 5"x7" post card, styled in combination with your objects

### Recommendations

- *Solving a problem* is rarely a useful framing for design in 2020, especially with experimental tools such as these. The tools are too new for us to know how they can most effectively be applied, and we are not yet looking at the world with the necessary sensitivity to even identify which problems can be remediated by these new methods. Much more productively, we could imagine *what new opportunities are exposed* given the existence of new tools and approaches, and how the world might change after our design intervention. It's a small nuance, but perhaps a helpful one? 

- Think carefully about whether your project will *whisper* or *shout* its data both in its form, and in its legibility. There is advantage in an object blending in, and an opposite advantage in standing-out as an obvious data visualization.

- Is your object extensible by its user? Could it be designed to be edited and manipulated? Is there an expectation that new objects are regularly created? Might there be a routine or ritual designed to facilitate self-reflection, data collection, and object editing/updating?

- Think carefully about which types of objects can most effectively trigger the contemplation of self. Further, think even more carefully about which sorts of data might be effective for a personal goal like this.

- Be weird. Do weird stuff. Make weird things. 


### Alternative Options

If any of the other tools, approaches, or algorithmic topic areas discussed during the arc of class is of more personal interest than the brief described above, please write a proposal of comparable specificity to this one, and send to Zach before B-Session begins to discuss.
