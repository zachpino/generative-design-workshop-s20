### 3D Printing and Laser-Cutting

We need to get some orders in by next Friday, May 1. Please prepare Grasshopper, Rhino, or Illustrator files for ordering from...

- [Shapeways for 3D Printing](https://www.shapeways.com)

- [Ponoko for Laser-Cutting](https://www.ponoko.com)

- [Spoonflower for (Fabric) Printing](https://www.shapeways.com)

Browse these site and make decisions around materiality and scale. Any other vendors we should be ordering from?

### Enclosed Data Helices

Plot data along helix, and enclose the form with a [minimal surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_surface). Additional steps with Weaverbird perforate the mesh irregularly.

### Homework

Do projects! Meet with Zach! Play with examples! Enjoy the fresh air but stay far away from people! 

Also, consider visiting the class homework delivery folder, and ensure you have uploaded homework files for each week.
