### Check-In

It's the end. We looked at a bunch of weird stuff. Time to decompress, chat, share our work, and get some perspective!

-----

###  Deliver Everything for Grading by 5/12/20

For [pass/fail] grading, all final deliverable assets need to be submitted by **Tuesday, May 12, at noon**. Please upload all assets [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w9fDwCYbV7QRsFCEHLPs5zE2aNf9kdxT). Work submitted in the other folders is already considered, so don't feel like you need to upload assets again. Make sure you've covered all the [requested deliverables](https://github.com/zachpino/generative-design-workshop-s20/blob/master/briefs.md), and double-check to make sure that you have submitted homework through the semester as well.

### Course Evaluations - Please?!

You get email reminders every day about this. [Please please pretty please fill out an evaluation for Generative Design Workshop?](ttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ID-Spring2020) Historically, Zach's classes at ID receive relatively few evaluations - maybe because students are always working up until the last minute? Please take 15 minutes, if you can stare at your screen a bit more, this week!

### Following the Tumultuous Generative Design World

New tools, approaches, and applications for Generative Design emerge every day, and many new papers and articles are fervently being written on many of the issues we have touched upon in this introductory course. Here is a random sampling of Generative Design and Data Visualization blogs that Zach checks regularly along with some learning resources, perhaps like and subscribe to a few of them?
