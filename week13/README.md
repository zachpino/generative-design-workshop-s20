### Agenda

- 3D Printing, Lasercutting, Printing Reminder
- Rhino Expiration/Purchase Strategy?
- Delivery

-----

### Check-In

Not a whole lot to chat about! Use the time to continue developing your project, and plan for some urgent requests from Zach this weekend while he is preparing orders, as well as ongoing meetings.

### Friendly Rendering Reminder

These tutorials were recommended several weeks ago, but remain highly relevant and recommended now that assets are being produced.

- [5 minute basic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jUMGqlVslc&list=TLPQMjkwNDIwMjCzFOCJHimzZQ&index=1) simple rendering demo
- [25 minute advanced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPnX3A6M1cI&t=1s) interior scene rendering demo
- [Custom materials and fancy features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bOfpm4iC9I) rendering demo

### Deliver Files for Fabrication by 5/1/20

We need to get some orders in by **Friday, May 1, end of day**. Please prepare Grasshopper, Rhino, or Illustrator files for ordering from...

- [Shapeways for 3D Printing](https://www.shapeways.com)

- [Ponoko for Laser-Cutting](https://www.ponoko.com)

- [Spoonflower for (Fabric) Printing](https://www.shapeways.com)

Please please please consult the limitations of the materials that you plan to use. For example, many 3D printed materials cannot be physicalized into very thin forms, which you'll need to address in Grasshopper before submitting files for fabrication. Similarly, laser-cut papers might scorch if cut lines get too close together.

Alternatively, let Zach know of any [crafting/fabrication supply requests](https://www.dickblick.com) for hand-making.

### Deliver Limited Assets for Class Discussion by 5/6/20

A Proposal for Discussion Next Week:

Everyone submits (several) renders, as well as their 5"x7" project description post card (consult [the deliverables](../briefs.md)) by **next Tuesday Evening, May 5** for class review. Zach will put together a gallery on Github of all projects, which we will review together before a structured conversation on some of the issues and opportunities brought to the fore by the introduction of data-oriented and generative design approaches.

###  Deliver Everything for Grading by 5/12/20

For [pass/fail] grading, all final deliverable assets need to be submitted by **Tuesday, May 12, at noon**.

-----

### Homework

Do projects! Meet with Zach! Prepare files! Go outside but stay dry in the rain! 

Also, consider visiting the class homework delivery folder, and ensure you have uploaded homework files for each week.
