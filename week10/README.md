### Attendance Note

Please only work in class for around 2 hours, and please use the remaining time to attend the online talk tonight (4/8/2020) with Knut Synstad from 6pm to 7pm. Ask questions, he's great!

### Follow Up

- Train line evolver continues to improve based on your questions and feedback! Download the [Grasshopper file](train-definition-v2.gh), which uses data pulled from [Simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities) to locate 50 high population US cities. Should we have a contest to see who can write the best algorithm for serving these cities?

- Take a peek at the purposefully titled [*For a Ruthless Criticism of Everything Existing: Rebellion Against the Quantitative-Qualitative Divide*](Patel-QuantQual.pdf) by Neal Patel of Google's analytics and data team for some provocative language on how the comforting quantitative-qualitative divide may or may not exist.

- [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com), referenced in passing last week, produces incredible visual explainers of many mathematical phenomena. Their [epidemic simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=gxAaO2rsdIs&feature=emb_logo) video is great, though their masterpiece is by all accounts their [video on quaternions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg&t=1523s), weirdly useful 4D imaginary numbers which facilitate 3-dimensional rotation in many generative design and other 3D contexts.

- Someone [modeled SARS-CoV-2](https://www.food4rhino.com/resource/covid-19) in Grasshopper!

### Nostalgic for Studio Ambiance?

If so, I'll leave [this soundscape generator](https://imisstheoffice.eu) here.

### Plugins

[Food4Rhino](http://www.food4rhino.com) is a central repository for plugins and add-on software for Rhino 3D, as well as for Grasshopper. Plugins for plugins! 

Create a free account on the website and search around. Anything exciting? Unfortunately, not everything will work on Macs and it's impossible to know unless you see an Apple logo under the *Download* button. But, even if *there is not an Apple logo*, it still might work!

To install a Grasshopper plugin, open Grasshopper, and navigate to File -> Special Folders -> Components Folder.

This will open a Finder/Explorer window, into which you can move the downloaded folder. The best practice is usually to drag the entire folder over, not the individual .gha or .ghuser files. You can find Grasshopper plugins all over the internet, not just at Food4Rhino. If you are running Windows, right click on any .exe, .ghuser, and .gha files and click on *Properties*. Make sure to click *Unblock* if it is an option.

For Grasshopper to load newly installed plugins, we need to **restart** Rhino.

### GeoJSON Map Data

Though Grasshopper can natively handle logitude-latitude couplets, the [Humpback](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/humpback) plugin is required to convert GeoJSON polygons into Grasshopper forms. Follow the installation instructions!

You would likely want to grab geojson files from places [like this](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Boundaries-Zoning-Districts-current-/7cve-jgbp) and simplify them with [Mapshaper](http://mapshaper.org). Befitting its name, Humpback is *slow*, and so requires simplified input data. There are likely better ways of parsing geographic data, but Humpback is a good place to start.
